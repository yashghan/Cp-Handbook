Motivation to study this concept:

To find if a particular node x is present in the subtree of node y.

int timer = 1;
bool dfs(int v){
    vis[v] = 1;
    In[v] = timer++;
    for(int child: adj[v]){
        if(vis[child] == 0){
           dfs(child);
        }
    }
    Out[v] = timer++;
}


Concept: (if the intime of node x is < than intime of node y) && (the outtime of node x > outtime of node y) then y is present in the subtree of node x)
         (if the intime of node x is < than intime of node y) && (the outtime of node x < outtime of node y) then x and y are present in different subtrees
